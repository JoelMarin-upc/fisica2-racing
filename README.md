# HYDROSPRINT

## Description

This project recreates a racing game where you must finish the race first to win, trying to avoid the slow zones and use the nitros around the map.
The project uses the Box2D v2.4.1 library to simulate realistic physics, it also uses the raylib v5.5.0 library to render graphics on the screen, and the pugixml library to load map data from files.

## Key Features

 - You control a fish and compete against many others.
 - Keep going forward & use the boosts around the map or your own nitro.
 - Avoid obstacles like the walls, jellyfish, or even other fish.
 - Be the first one to cross the winning line.
 - Choose your preferred map, difficulty, lap amount or vehicle.
 - When you finish, restart to play again at the moment.
